## DataLoom

I have deployed a PoC using Pandas and Streamlit, you can check it [here](https://github.com/rubzip/dataLoom_Demo): 
### About Me
I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Natural Language Processing, building upon my background in physics. My journey has equipped me with valuable experience in handling data, honing skills in data science, and delving into backend development. This interdisciplinary blend enables me to approach NLP with a comprehensive perspective, drawing from both technical expertise and analytical prowess. I also have experience developing front and backend websites.

### Project Introduction
This project aims to develop a web-based GUI for data wrangling, simplifying the management and transformation of tabular datasets. Users will securely log in, upload datasets, and utilize intuitive pandas functionalities for tasks like filtering and sorting. Realtime previews and user-specific workspaces will enhance usability. The backend, based on FastAPI, ensures scalability and security. A draft will be shared with the mentor before final submission.

### Project Goals
1. Develop a user-friendly web-based GUI for data wrangling.
2. Define and implement all necessary functions for data transformations, including filtering, sorting, and joining.
3. Design and develop an intuitive UI for seamless user interaction.
4. Coordinate the development of the backend infrastructure to ensure scalability and security.

### What I Plan to Accomplish Over This Summer for This Project
- **Project:** Dataloom
- **Approach:**
    - Develop and test pandas functions for data transformation.
    - Implement FastAPI backend.
    - Implement FrontEnd (React).
    - (Extra) Add visualization features (Plotly).

### Plans for the Summer
I have plenty of time in the summer, typically working as a teacher, programmer, or waiter. If accepted, my main task during the summer would be to work on this project. I usually take one week for traveling.

### Education
- **Year in School:** Master‚Äôs degree
- **Programming Courses:** Data Structures, Algorithms, various data-related courses, currently studying Front and Backend.
- **Major:** Physics, and NLP.
- **Group Projects:** Yes, I have worked as a data scientist at Ernst & Young.
- **Primary Contribution/Role:** I deployed a model and the API for a big project, also worked on other programming projects at work and in university.

### Work Experience in Programming
I mostly have worked with the Python data stack (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.), but I‚Äôm currently learning web programming (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and Django).

Here it is the [Readme file](https://github.com/rubzip/dataLoom_Demo/blob/main/README.md): 
# Dataloom PoC üí°

## Overview üåê

Dataloom is a web-based GUI designed to streamline the process of data wrangling, making the management and transformation of tabular datasets an intuitive and efficient task. This project, is a proof of concept for the Google Summer of Code.

## Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The goal of Dataloom is to provide users with a user-friendly interface that allows for secure login, dataset upload, and utilization of familiar pandas functionalities for tasks such as filtering and sorting. Real-time previews and user-specific workspaces will further enhance usability, ensuring that users can interact with their data effortlessly.

## Features üöÄ

 - [x] **Web-based GUI**: Access Dataloom from any web browser, enabling users to work with their datasets anytime, anywhere.
 - [ ] **Dataset Upload**: Easily upload tabular datasets to the platform for analysis and manipulation.
 - [x] **Pandas Functionality**: Utilize intuitive pandas functionalities for tasks like filtering, sorting, and transformation.
 - [x] **Real-time Previews**: Instantly preview changes to datasets as you make them, enhancing the interactive experience.
 - [ ] **Backend based on FastAPI**: TODO.
 - [ ] **Frontend based on JavaScript**: TODO, PoC was done using Streamlit.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with Dataloom, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit application by executing `streamlit run main.py` in your terminal.
4. Access Dataloom through your web browser by navigating to the provided URL.

## Usage üìù

Yet, Dataloom has a simple interface where you can apply simple SQL functions as Select, Filter, GroupBy, and find most important information.
