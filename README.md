# DataLoom
Project is to design and implement a web-based GUI for data wrangling, aimed at simplifying the process of managing and transforming tabular datasets. This application will serve as a graphical interface for the powerful Python library, allowing users to perform complex data manipulation tasks without the need for in-depth programming knowledge. 

### Apps and Packages

- `frontend`: a React.js app
- `Docs`: React.js app for tutorials regarding DataLoom
- `backend`:  Python(FastAPI) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
